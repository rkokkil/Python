# oop-concepts

OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming

## fundamentals

In OOP, basic things to learn is about Class and Object and it's concepts.
Class and Object are called building blocks.

OOP Concepts are 
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism

### Inheritance
In any OOP language (Java, Python, C++, C#, ASP.NET, etc), inheritance means getting fields and properties from Parent class.
It means we will have Parent class and Child class. Child class gets fields/functions from Parent class.

Class contains - 
- fields or properties (either instance variables, class variables, etc)
- functions or methods (either instance methods, class methods, static methods, etc)
- constructors

e.g.:
In this project, Employee is parent class.
Developer and Manager are child classes and they are inheriting fields (or properties), 
functions (or methods) and constructors from parent class (Employee).


Model classes -
Class (template)
 - instance variables
 - class variables (applicable for all objects created from this class)
 - constructor
 - setter/getter functions (optional)

Using template we create an Object

stage-3
Design Patterns
Gang of Four Design patterns (4 people found/identified 23 patterns)
what are patterns?
patterns commonly used approaches which are repeating in all most all projects across computer science

23 are divided into 3 categories
Creational patterns
structural patterns
behavioural patterns
